# path_tracer
A simple sphere path tracer for learning purposes.

I initially did the [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial, and now I'm building a more complicated one. I'm planning on optimizing this one (in software/cpu land, no hardware acceleration) and making a little physics plus video renderer.
